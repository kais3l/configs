# NEOVIM COMMANDS TO REMEMBER IN CASE YOU FORGET THEM IN THE FUTURE

1. ```<space><space>x``` in normal mode sources the current file
2. ```<space>x``` in normal mode sources file with the .lua extensions
3. ```<space>x``` in virtual mode sources the currently selected lines
4. ```<space>fh``` in normal mode opens up a telescope window that shows all the available help options for lazy.nvim(and presumably all the available help pages for anything basically). TLDR: if you need help, use this shortcut. 
5. ```<space>fd``` in normal mode opens up a telescope window that shows all the available files in the cwd 
6. ```<space>en``` in normal mode opens up a telescope window to the neovim config directory from anywhere while using neovim. 
7. ```<space>ep``` in normal mode opens up a telescope window that will show every single plugin related file.
8. ```<leader>fg``` in normal mode will initiate a "multigrep" window that will help us find particular keywords in files(like function calls and references). Alternatively you can find files by their extensionos by preceeding the file names with _two spaces_ and then typing the extension type like this: ```  *.lua```.
